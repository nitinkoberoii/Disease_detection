## About The Project

This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on the detection of diseases using predictive models. The core of this project is a Jupyter Notebook (`Disease_detection.ipynb`) that demonstrates a complete workflow from data preprocessing and exploration to model training, evaluation, and making predictions.

The primary goal is to provide a clear, reproducible example of how machine learning techniques can be applied to health-related datasets for diagnostic purposes. While this project serves as a foundational example, it highlights key steps involved in building a robust disease detection system.

## Features

*   **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes data distributions and relationships to gain insights.
*   **Machine Learning Model Training:** Implements and trains a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, or Random Forest).
*   **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
*   **Prediction Pipeline:** Demonstrates how to use the trained model for new, unseen data.
*   **Jupyter Notebook Format:** Provides an interactive and step-by-step execution environment.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher recommended) and `pip` for package management.

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codezyman/Disease_detection.git
    cd Disease_detection
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    While a `requirements.txt` is not provided, the `Disease_detection.ipynb` notebook likely uses common data science libraries. You can install them manually:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
    ```
    *Note: If you encounter issues, inspect the notebook for specific imports and install any missing libraries.*

## Usage

After installing the prerequisites, you can run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the project.

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Open the Notebook:**
    Your web browser will open a new tab with the Jupyter interface. Navigate to `Disease_detection.ipynb` and click on it to open the notebook.

3.  **Run the Cells:**
    Execute the cells sequentially within the notebook. Each cell contains code for a specific step in the disease detection pipeline (data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, etc.).

    *Example of a typical notebook flow:*

    ```python
    # Cell 1: Import necessary libraries
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns

    # Cell 2: Load the dataset
    # Make sure your dataset (e.g., 'patient_data.csv') is in the correct path
    try:
        df = pd.read_csv('data/patient_data.csv')
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Dataset 'data/patient_data.csv' not found. Please ensure it's in the 'data/' directory.")
        # Create a dummy dataframe for demonstration if file not found
        data = {
            'Age': [30, 45, 60, 25, 55],
            'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Male', 'Female', 'Male'],
            'Symptoms': ['Fever', 'Cough', 'Fatigue', 'Fever', 'Headache'],
            'Diagnosis': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0] # 0 for Healthy, 1 for Disease
        }
        df = pd.DataFrame(data)
        print("Using dummy data for demonstration.")

    print(df.head())

    # Cell 3: Preprocessing (example)
    # Define categorical and numerical features
    categorical_features = ['Gender', 'Symptoms']
    numerical_features = ['Age']

    # Create preprocessing pipelines for numerical and categorical features
    preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
        transformers=[
            ('num', StandardScaler(), numerical_features),
            ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), categorical_features)
        ])

    # Cell 4: Define model pipeline
    model_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                                     ('classifier', LogisticRegression(solver='liblinear'))])

    # Cell 5: Split data and train model
    X = df.drop('Diagnosis', axis=1)
    y = df['Diagnosis']
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    model_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Cell 6: Evaluate model
    y_pred = model_pipeline.predict(X_test)
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.2f}")
    print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
    print("\nConfusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

    # Cell 7: Make a prediction on new data
    new_patient_data = pd.DataFrame([{
        'Age': 40,
        'Gender': 'Female',
        'Symptoms': 'Cough'
    }])
    prediction = model_pipeline.predict(new_patient_data)
    print(f"\nPrediction for new patient: {'Disease' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'Healthy'}")
    ```

## Project Structure

The repository has a simple structure, primarily containing the core Jupyter Notebook.

```
Disease_detection/
├── Disease_detection.ipynb  # The main Jupyter Notebook for disease detection
└── README.md                # This README file
```

## Dataset

This project expects a dataset to be present for training and evaluation. While a specific dataset is not included in this repository, it is designed to work with tabular data related to patient health records.

*   **Expected Format:** A CSV file (e.g., `patient_data.csv`) containing features relevant to disease prediction (e.g., age, gender, symptoms, lab results) and a target column indicating the diagnosis (e.g., `Diagnosis` where 0 might be "Healthy" and 1 "Diseased").
*   **Placement:** It is recommended to create a `data/` directory in the root of the repository and place your dataset file inside it (e.g., `data/patient_data.csv`). The notebook assumes this path.

## Model Details

The `Disease_detection.ipynb` notebook implements a classification model. While the specific algorithm can vary based on the notebook's content, common choices for such problems include:

*   **Logistic Regression:** A simple yet powerful linear model for binary classification.
*   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Effective in high-dimensional spaces and for cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
*   **Random Forest:** An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results for improved accuracy and robustness.

The notebook demonstrates the typical machine learning pipeline: feature engineering, model selection, training, and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
